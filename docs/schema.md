# üì¶ Inventory Management System ‚Äî Database Schema

Welcome! This repository outlines a comprehensive and extensible **Inventory, Procurement, and Sales** database schema designed for real-world warehouse and supply chain operations.

---

## üîç Overview

This schema supports:

- Multi-warehouse product storage with bin-level tracking
- Lot & serial number traceability
- Product bundles (kits) made of components
- Supplier and customer management
- Purchase and sales order workflows
- Reordering rules for restocking
- Audit logging and data integrity constraints

The design aims to balance **data normalization**, **performance**, and **future scalability**, making it suitable for ERP, WMS, e-commerce backends, or B2B distribution platforms.

## üîÑ Key Relationships

- A **company** owns multiple **warehouses**
- A **warehouse** has many **bins**
- A **product** may be a bundle (composed of other products)
- **Products** can be supplied by multiple **suppliers**
- **Inventory** is tracked per bin, product, lot, and/or serial
- **Inventory transactions** record every change in stock (receipt, sale, return, etc.)
- **Purchase orders** and **sales orders** flow through line items, driving inventory movements

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features

### ‚úÖ Lot and Serial Tracking
- Supports **perishable or regulated goods** (batches with expiry dates)
- Tracks high-value serialized items for warranty or compliance

### üì¶ Bundles (Kits)
- Products can represent multi-SKU bundles
- Selling a bundle deducts the component items from inventory

### üßÆ Reorder Rules
- Automate reordering based on **min/max thresholds**
- Enables demand forecasting and procurement planning

### üìä Price History
- Historical product pricing with optional multi-currency support
- Useful for auditing, analytics, and promotional tracking

### üîê Audit Logging
- Full **change tracking** with user attribution
- Records all inserts, updates, and deletes for critical tables

## üß† Design Philosophy

- **Normalization with performance**: Core data (products, warehouses, etc.) are normalized, but key snapshots (inventory state) are denormalized for fast querying.
- **Extensibility**: JSONB fields and modular tables allow for evolving requirements (e.g., contact details, extra metadata).
- **Auditability**: Most tables include `created_at`, and critical actions log to `audit_log`.
- **Flexibility**: You can run the schema with or without features like lots, serials, or bundles depending on business needs.
