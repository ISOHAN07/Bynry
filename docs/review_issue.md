1. No input validation
    1. All fields (name, sku, price, warehouse_id, initial_quantity) are accepted blindly due to which the following errors may arise
        1. There might be some missing keys which might cause a KeyError crash
        2. There is no handling for the optional fields
        3. Wrong data types can be entered like - String for price causing TypeError
    
    2. Impact
        1. If a client omits price or sku, we’ll get a KeyError and a 500‑level crash. That means every bad request could bring down the endpoint or leave the client confused with an uncaught exception stack trace.
        2. When fields that were intended to be optional aren’t explicitly allowed, clients have no safe way to omit them. We’ll either crash or end up writing null/empty values that downstream reports and integrations can’t interpret.

2. Over‑Posting Risk
    1. Passing raw JSON fields directly into the ORM constructor opens the door to clients setting fields we didn’t intend (e.g. is_active, created_at). This may cause problems like security vulnerability and data integrity risks.

    2. Impact
        1. If a malicious client includes "is_active": false or a crafted "created_at", they can disable products or back‑date records. That undermines both security (e.g. enabling/disabling products without permission) and data integrity (audit logs become meaningless).

3. Improper Data Type for Price
    1. The code treats price as a generic float, rather than fixed decimal due to this the floating‑point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors

    2. Impact
        1. Storing prices as native floats can introduce small rounding discrepancies (e.g. $19.99 become $19.989999). When multiplied across invoices, that leads to dollar‑level mismatches, accounting headaches, and potential compliance issues.

4. No SKU Uniqueness Enforcement
    1. There is no application‑level check or database constraint to guarantee that sku is unique across the entire platform. Having similar sku will break the product lookups, integrations and other errors among many.

    2. Impact
        1. Two products with the same SKU will overwrite each other in caches or external systems (ERP, fulfillment). We risk shipping the wrong item, returning incorrect stock levels, and creating mis‑shipped orders at scale.

5. Issue of having separate commits
    1. There are two separate commits, first for the products and then for the inventory, if the second commit fails then there will be a ghost product in the inventory causing problems.

    2. Impact
        1. If the inventory commit fails (e.g. DB deadlock, constraint violation), we’ll have a product in the catalog with no inventory record. Sales teams will see products they can’t actually stock; customers will encounter “out of stock” errors on items that technically exist.

6. No integrity check
    1. The code never verifies that warehouse_id corresponds to an existing Warehouse. If the warehouse_id does not exist then it will lead to inventory records pointing to invalid warehouses, corrupting stock reports and subsequent queries.

    2. Impact
        1. Writing an Inventory record against a non‑existent warehouse ID corrupts our stock tables. Reporting queries will either silently drop those rows or blow up with foreign‑key errors, leading to incomplete or incorrect stock dashboards.

7. Rigid Product–Warehouse Coupling
    1. The Product model is given a single warehouse_id, yet your business rule is “products can exist in multiple warehouses." Due to this we'll be unable to record stock in more than one location.

    2. Impact
       1. Because warehouse_id lives on the Product, the moment we try to add stock in a second warehouse we must either overwrite the first or invent ad‑hoc workarounds. That leads to data-model hacks, brittle queries, and ultimately inaccurate stock levels.

8. Zero Error Handling and Rollback Logic
    1. No try/except wrapping the DB operations due to which the clients receive no meaningful feedback also the partial transactions may cause issues like getting hanged or locked.

    2. Impact
        1. Clients get a generic “Internal Server Error,” with no clue what went wrong or how to retry. Meanwhile, any locks or half‑written transactions can leave the DB in a bad state, causing cascading failures under load.

9. Incorrect HTTP Semantics
    1. Always returns status 200, even on failure or invalid input due to this the clients cannot distinguish success from failure by HTTP status code. 

    2. Impact 
        1. Returning 200 even on failure violates REST norms. Clients assume success, proceed to next steps, and only discover the error later when data isn’t there. Automated tooling (SDKs, retries) that rely on status codes will break silently.

10. Coupling Product Creation with Inventory Initialization
    1. The endpoint forces every new product to be created with an initial stock record in a single warehouse—even though, by oour requirements, products may live in multiple warehouses and we may not always want to stock them immediately upon creation.

    2. Impact
        1. Forcing an initial stock tie‑in means we can’t register a new product ahead of shipment. We either commit a dummy “0” record (which pollutes our audit trail) or delay catalog setup until physical inventory arrives, slowing go‑to‑market. It also makes it impossible to track subsequent stock changes in isolation.
